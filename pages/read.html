                            Germany striker Miroslav Klose came off the bench to score a record-equalling 15th World Cup goal and salvage a 2-2 draw against Ghana in a pulsating Group G game on Saturday.
With his first touch two minutes after coming on, Klose poked home at the back post from a Toni Kroos corner in the 71st minute to move level with former Brazil striker Ronaldo.
He becomes only the third man after compatriot Uwe Seeler and Brazil’s Pele to score in four World Cups.
“Twenty (World Cup) matches and 15 goals is not bad at all,” Klose said. “But what’s important is that we have a good match against the United States.”
                            
<h4>Strong Germany</h4>
                        
Germany, who are top of the group with four points, face the Americans in their final group match in Recife on Thursday while Ghana, with one point, play Portugal in Brasilia.
The United States (three points) take on bottom-side Portugal in their second match on Sunday.
Germany coach Joachim Loew said his players were “exhausted” from an engrossing encounter in which the Germans took the lead, trailed 2-1 before fighting back to secure a point.
